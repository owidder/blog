        <h2>Install Git 1.9 on CentOS on Google Compute Engine</h2>
        <span>
            I just installed Git 1.9 on a Google Compute Engine virtual machine running CentOS.<br>
	    These were the steps which led to success:<br>
	    At first I followed the steps from <a href="http://johnathanmarksmith.com/linux/git/programming/2013/05/15/how-to-install-git-182-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-and-scientific-linux/">Jonathan Mark Smith</a> for Git 1.8.2:
        </span>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint">
	  yum install gettext-devel expat-devel curl-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel
	  cd /usr/local/src
	  wget https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/git-1.8.2.3.tar.gz
	  tar xzvf git-1.8.2.3.tar.gz
	  cd git-1.8.2.3
	  make prefix=/usr/local all
	  make prefix=/usr/local install
        </pre>
        
        <span>
	  But I got an error saying something like 'Can't locate ExtUtils/MakeMaker.pm'.<br>
	  Shoot!<br>
	  Google to my rescue I found a <a href="http://madcoda.com/2013/09/cant-locate-extutilsmakemaker-pm-while-compile-git/">great post on Mad Coder's Blog</a> with the following advice:
        </span>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint">
	  yum install perl-devel
        </pre>
        
        <span>
            Now I ran the last two make commands again and I was fine. 
        </span>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint">
	  make prefix=/usr/local all
	  make prefix=/usr/local install
        </pre>
        
        <script>prettyPrint();</script>
    </body>
