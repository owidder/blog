    <h2>My new Chromebook</h2>
    
    <span>
        Santa got me a Chromebook last Christmas (maybe it was myself, I don't know any more). Now my goal is to make cloud development. 
        The whole 9 yards. With a cloud IDE, cloud servers and all that jazz.
        And here I write down what I have learned.

    <h2>The cloud IDE</h2>
    
    <span>
        To be frank my decision making process for the cloud IDE was quite simple.<br>
        I tried two them (<a href="http://codenvy.com/"> CloudEnvy</a> and <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a>), found Cloud9 the better solution and chose it.<br>
        Why do I like it more?<br>
        <ol>
            <li>You have full Linux VM with all a geek could dream of (Git, Python, Perl, ...)</li>
            <li>That's all and more than enough. All the other goodies (like a connection to Github) does Codenvy have too.</li>
        </ol>
