        UPDATE: There is a new post about a much improved version of this script: 
        <a href="http://geek-and-poke.com/geekpoke-gets-serious/2014/1/26/lost-in-the-git-orcus-part-3">
            Lost in the Git Orcus (Part 3)
        </a>
    
        <h2>Find lost files deep deep in the catacombs of Git</h2>
        <span>
            <p>
                <a href="http://geek-and-poke.com/geekpoke-gets-serious/2013/11/10/lost-in-the-git-orcus">Last year I posted a 
                script to find lost files deep in the .git/objects folder</a>.<br>
                But the way I chose was not the smartest:<br>
                It scanned all tree objects for a given file name (or pattern) 
                and searched for commits pointing to this tree.<br>
                But since only the root tree has a commit pointing to it the script could only find 
                files in the root folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                That was dumb from my side. So I fixed it and made it much simpler:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>It searches for trees or blobs  containing the given pattern (it could also search for commits or tags if you wanted to)</li>
                    <li>It it finds a blob it just logs it out</li>
                    <li>If it finds a tree it creates a commit pointing to it via 'git commit-tree' and a branch pointing to this tree</li>
                </ul>
                Searching for the contents of blobs may be necessary. E.g. if the file you are searching for never made it into a commit,
                but was part of the index (and therefore could be somewhere in the object store if the gc has not already removed it).
            </p>
        </span>
        <h2>The script</h2>
        <span>
            The script has 3 parameters:
            <ol>
                <li>The object type to search in. Can be 'tree', 'blob', 'tag' or 'commit'</li>
                <li>The pattern to search for</li>
                <li>'y' if you want to create commits and branches (only when type='tree')</li>
            </ol>
            The script is super simple, has no bells and zero whistles. So feel free to --amend it.<br>
            You can also find it on <a href="https://github.com/owidder/git-goodies/blob/master/perl/search-objects.pl">Github (in its newest version)</a>
        </span>
        
        <h2>Possible improvements</h2>
        Galore!<br>
        Just some examples:
        <ul>
            <li>Make it more convenient: Use options, print a help text, ...</li>
            <li>Search also in the pack file</li>
            <li>To make it faster: Search at first in the reflog of the HEAD and the branches</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        I will implement the second bullet above soon. Stay tuned!
